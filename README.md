# React Portfolio Website.

I've never made a website with NextJS or React so this is still a work in progress. I'm probably overly reliant on traditional HTML/CSS and want to make this closer to an intended react site down the line. First step was to get the new design how I intended it to be and we can build from there.

## TODO
- Add a tooltip to the copyright at the bottom of the page to incldue camera/photo information
- Animate slight color banding or gradients to add a little visual flair to the blurred card. This should be minimal and not distracting. Probably OpenGL? Not sure
- Setting the theme-color to the average color of the page
- Geolocation difference "2,000 miles away" next to the San Francisco `title`
- Make link buttons better. Kinda plain at the moment.
- Lower Quality background-image
